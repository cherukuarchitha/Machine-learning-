    st.write("""### Measures for Increasing Customer Retention and Revenue:

To increase the revenue and also minimize the customer churn following of the implementations can be followed by observing the above modelâ€™s evaluation metrics.

Senior citizens, people living with a partner, and people living alone should be targeted as clients.
The number of Senior Citizen consumers is small, but their monthly charge limit is higher than that of other customers. Thus, SeniorCitizen clients are willing to spend top price for exceptional service. Clients with a Partner and customers living alone prefer services with MonthlyCharges under 65.

In order to build a robust customer base, a telecommunications company must provide an accessible and reasonable entry point for their services. For the first six months, it must focus heavily on OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, and TechSupport, as this is the most critical and unpredictable period for clients. They must reduce the churn tenure of 40 - 50 months for these services.

Once they have established a robust pipeline of customer support services, they must promote the use of MultipleLines and Fiber Optic cables for PhoneService and InternetService, respectively. However, the beginning point of 75+ in MonthlyCharges is a considerable barrier for these two services.
As a result, they must construct combinations of PhoneService and InternetService options with average MonthlyCharges in the range of 100 - 120:
No multiple lines, multiple lines of optical fiber along with DSL
will enhance a user's average income because it eliminates the option of selecting a combination of 
No MultipleLines along with DSL, which has a mean MonthlyCharge of 60 - 70.

It's important to lower the cost of streaming TV and movies while also lowering turnover. All customer types should be catered to in the content of these services. Following this, a simple and hassle-free payment method is required.



Customers become particularly sensitive of their MonthlyCharges whenever the MonthlyCharges for any single service reach the 70 threshold. The standard of service must be maintained.

Both the LightGBM and the XGBoost algorithms are working well, but are predicting based upon different dimensions. It is also worth noting that the predictions are skewed by the imbalance in the dataset but we have used SMOTE technique to balance the data and performed the models again. We have obtained better results after this implementation.""")
